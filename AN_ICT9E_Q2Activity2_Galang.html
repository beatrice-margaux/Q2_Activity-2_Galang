	<h1>Sonnet 20: A woman’s face with nature’s own hand painted</h1>
		<h3>by William Shakespeare</h3>

			<div>
			<p>A woman’s face with nature’s own hand painted
			<br>
			Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;
			<br>
			A woman’s gentle heart, but not acquainted
			<br>
			With shifting change as is false women’s fashion;
			<br>
			An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,
			<br>
			Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;
			<br>
			A man in hue, all hues in his controlling,
			<br>
			Which steals men’s eyes and women’s souls amazeth.
			<br>
			And for a woman wert thou first created,
			<br>
			Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,
			<br>
			And by addition me of thee defeated
			<br>
			By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
			<br>
     		But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,
     		<br>
     		Mine be thy love and thy love’s use their treasure.</p>
     		</div>
